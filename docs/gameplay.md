# 1042 Gameplay

## Inital notes

- This game is designed to be a survival adventure game, thus it is reccomended to try to figure things out first.
- The game machanics in 1042 are not the same as most games on the luanti engine, thus I will write a gameplay manual.


## Controles

Controles are slightly different in 1042. To eat/use some items you use the `aux1` key insted of rightclick/leftclick this is so you can still treat items as nodes.


## Breaking nodes

Some nodes can be broken by hand, others require tools

### Stones

Stone nodes must be broken with a pick

### Woods

Wood nodes must be broken with an axe


## Cooking

If you get some raw food, like pork from a pig, you can cook it:

 * either near near a fire
 * or on a campfire

After a given interval, the food will cook.

If you get something that need to be heated to a higher temperature, you'll need to use an oven or placing the item beside a [block of burning charcoal](#starting-fires).

If you want to use an oven, you must [create one](#oven) and [create a mold](#mold). Right-click the mold with the item to cook, and pick un the filled mold. You can now place it in the oven and wait for it to finish cooking!

## Mining

Ores are worthless in their natrual state, they must be broken into nuggets in order to be processed. This is done by mining them with a pick. Once mined they can be aranged into a 3x3 square in the crafting slots in your invintory to make a nugget block.


## Refining metals

> See [Cooking](#cooking)

## Starting fires

This is a fairly simple task, find some iron nuggets and some flint. When you have found some flint, take it and put it right next to the node you want to light. After doing this you start to beat (`aux1`) the flint with the iron nugget. This should produce a lot of sparks and the fire should ignite after a few attempts. It can take a while sometimes so don't give up to quickly. Some things like wood burn to charcoal, this can be used to melt metals.


## Tools

Tools are used to do some tasks, like mine or cut wood.

### Chisel

The chisel is used toâ€¦ chisel blocs! There are:

| Final node |   Requirement  | Durration |
|:-----------|:--------------:|----------:|
| Oven	   | 2 stone blocks |	  16 s |
| Mold	   |	 a rock	 |	   8 s |

## Usefull nodes

### The Oven

An oven is used to cook pretty everything at hight temperature, see [Cooking](#cooking).

To create one, find 2 stone blocks one on top of the other and by right-clicking on the bottom one with a [chisel](#chisel), you'll be able to choose it. Then, use a campfire to give it everything he needs to work.

### The Mold

The mold is used to prepare items like raw ores before cooking them in an oven. (see [Cooking](#cooking) and [Oven](#the-oven))

Creating one is easy, just find a rock, right-click on it with a [chisel](#chisel) and select the mold.
